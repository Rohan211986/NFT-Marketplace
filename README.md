# NFT Marketplace

## Project Description
A decentralized marketplace allowing users to list ERC‑721 NFTs for sale and purchase them. Built in Solidity with simple listing, buying, and cancellation features.

## Project Vision
Empower NFT creators and collectors with a lean, secure marketplace core that can be extended into larger platforms (e.g., adding auctions, fees, royalties).

## Key Features
- 🏷 **listItem**: Securely list your NFT for sale (price > 0, approval needed)
- 🛒 **buyItem**: Purchase listed NFTs via ETH transfer
- ❌ **cancelListing**: Remove your NFT listing anytime before purchase

## Future Scope
- Platform fees (e.g., 2.5%) and royalty support
- Batch listing and purchases
- Auction or bidding mechanics
- Front-end integration and off-chain indexing (e.g., The Graph)
- Security hardening (ReentrancyGuard, safe math, Gas optimization)
